## Coding techniques
___
- HTML
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Grid

## What I have learned

I have learned that Grid is easier than it looks, because before I have used flexbox for collage and it is a little bit trickier. It was a real eye opener and I am going to use grid for other projects in the near future.
